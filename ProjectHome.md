## About ##

file2folder GUI is a VB .Net translation of a small batch script I wrote a while back.  The script just took all the files of its hosting directory and created and moved them into a directory of the same name.  This was the required directory structure for the [Media Browser](http://mediabrowser.tv) Media Center plugin.  It is also useful for other HTPC frontends.

I am a total beginner to any kind of programming, short of batch scripting.  I'm an old systems administrator, so that's all I've ever really done.  I've tried to get into programming a few times, but never really found a project that I could stay interested in...mostly because no book offers a project that would be useful to me.  That's where making this a Visual Basic application comes in.  It's something I use very frequently and it is a good candidate for additional features - all of which will allow me to learn VB.

## Features ##

<img src='http://www.thehtpc.net/images/f2fguiexample.jpg' align='right' width='354' height='246'>Right now the feature set is a little bare, but it is still a vast improvement over the batch script.  Currently, version 1.4.4.0 includes:<br>
<br>
<ol><li>A GUI, of course :)<br>
</li><li>Either manual directory entry, or directory browsing via GUI<br>
</li><li>UNC pathnames are now supported (network shares without drive mapping)<br>
</li><li>Undo last move process (thanks to <a href='http://v2.themetabrowser.com'>fatal</a>)<br>
</li><li>Drag-and-drop a folder directly into the interface<br>
</li><li>Progress indicator with process complete notification<br>
</li><li>Auto and manual online update check<br>
</li><li>Folder monitoring so you can minimize to system tray and let it process in the background<br>
</li><li>Rudimentary multi-part file support.  Multi-part files can be ignored so you can handle them manually<br>
</li><li>Hidden and system file protection<br>
</li><li>More!</li></ol>

I plan on implementing much more, but it will probably all come at a snail's pace as this will also be a learning process for me.  Send me your suggestions!<br>
