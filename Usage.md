# Quick Start #

There really isn't much to using file2folder:
  1. Browse to, manually enter or a drag-and-drop a valid directory right into the interface.
  1. Click the **Move!** button.
  1. Complete your movie collection with the metadata program of your choice.  I recommend [meta&lt;browser&gt;](http://v2.themetabrowser.com).

# Features #

file2folder GUI has many features in comparison to the script:

  * GUI (of course!)
  * Directory browsing or manual entry
  * UNC pathname support (network shares!)
  * Undo last move
  * Drag-and-drop directory name recognition
  * Process logging with ability to save
  * Files with "Hidden" and "System" attributes are safely ignored
  * Options for auto-closing and/or opening processed directory after moving
  * Progress tracking
  * Automatic and manual online update check
  * Timed folder monitoring
  * Can operate from system tray
